LinkedIn prototype
======================

This Node.js sample application uses the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to build a simple, scalable customer signup form that is deployed to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). The application stores data in [Amazon DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and publishes notifications to the [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) when a customer fills out the form.
